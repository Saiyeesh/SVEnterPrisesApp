                <p>Non-woven bags have become increasingly popular in recent years as a more sustainable alternative to traditional plastic bags. These bags are made from spunbonded polypropylene fibers, which are bonded together through heat and pressure. Unlike plastic bags, which can take hundreds of years to decompose, non-woven bags are biodegradable and can break down in as little as a few months.</p>
                <p>India has emerged as a major hub for the manufacturing of non-woven bags. There are several reasons for this. First, India is a major producer of polypropylene, the key raw material used in the production of non-woven bags. Second, India has a large pool of skilled labor, which has helped to drive down the cost of production. Finally, the Indian government has implemented several initiatives aimed at promoting the use of non-woven bags as a more eco-friendly alternative to plastic bags.</p>
